		<h1>OPEN LETTER</h1>
		<p>
			I'm a software engineer with over five years of experience, an avid learner with strong creative and analytical skills and blablabla.
		</p>

		<p>
			Just between us, for real no cap bro:
			I'm f*cking tired of this rat race and I don't give a damn about the values of your unique big company, project and/or brand that in the ends just makes the rich even richer while the laborer ones just get sick and burnout.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unless you're a real person, with real problems, or are really trying to help the humanity, I'm not interest working with you. I f*cking love create solutions and I promissed to myself in my last burnout that I'll not develop one single line of code or a drawing for projects that I don't really believe.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'll not allow this sick world turn off my creativity again.
		</p>

		<p>
			And of course, I care about my own projects and personal life. Oh, and I like to draw and sharks too :)
		</p>

			Byyyeee â™¡
